    "faqPage.title1": "Frequently asked",
    "faqPage.title2": "questions",
    "faqPage.description": "Find answers to common questions about our desiccants, applications, and services.",
    "faqPage.q1": "What is a desiccant and how does it work?",
    "faqPage.a1": "A desiccant is a hygroscopic substance that induces or sustains a state of dryness in its vicinity. It absorbs water molecules from the surrounding air, effectively reducing humidity levels. Our desiccants use materials like silica gel, clay (Moclay), and calcium chloride to protect products from moisture damage during storage and shipping.",
    "faqPage.q2": "Which desiccant is right for my application?",
    "faqPage.a2": "The right desiccant depends on several factors: the type of goods being protected, humidity levels, duration of protection needed, and regulatory requirements. Silica gel is ideal for pharmaceuticals and electronics. Clay-based products like DRY-BAG I and III are excellent for container shipping. Calcium chloride is best for heavy-duty, long-haul ocean freight. Contact our experts for personalized recommendations.",
    "faqPage.q3": "How much desiccant do I need for my container?",
    "faqPage.a3": "The amount of desiccant needed depends on the container size, contents, expected transit time, and climate conditions. As a general rule, for a 20ft container, you might need 8-12 units of DRY-BAG for standard shipments. For high-humidity routes or sensitive cargo, more may be required. Our team can help calculate the exact requirements for your specific situation.",
    "faqPage.q4": "Are your desiccants safe for use with food products?",
    "faqPage.a4": "Yes, our silica gel and clay-based desiccants (DRY-BAG I and III) are made with FDA-approved materials and are safe for use in food-adjacent applications. They are non-toxic and chemically inert. However, they should not be consumed. For specific food safety certifications, please contact us.",
    "faqPage.q5": "Can desiccants be regenerated and reused?",
    "faqPage.a5": "Some of our desiccants can be regenerated. DRY BAG Retail is specifically designed to be regenerable—simply dry the contents in an oven to restore absorption capacity. Silica gel can also be regenerated in some cases. Clay-based shipping desiccants are typically single-use due to their heavy-duty nature.",
    "faqPage.q6": "What is 'container rain' and how do desiccants prevent it?",
    "faqPage.a6": "Container rain occurs when temperature fluctuations during shipping cause moisture in the air inside a container to condense on the container walls and ceiling, then drip onto cargo. This can cause mold, corrosion, and water damage. Desiccants absorb excess moisture from the air, preventing condensation from forming.",
    "faqPage.q7": "How should desiccants be stored before use?",
    "faqPage.a7": "Desiccants should be stored in their original, sealed packaging until ready for use. Keep them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Once the packaging is opened, unused desiccants should be resealed in airtight containers or bags to prevent premature moisture absorption.",
    "faqPage.q8": "Do you offer custom sizes or formulations?",
    "faqPage.a8": "Yes, we offer custom solutions for specific applications. Whether you need particular sizes, packaging types, or absorption capacities, our team can work with you to develop a tailored moisture control solution. Contact us to discuss your requirements.",
    "faqPage.q9": "What shipping options are available?",
    "faqPage.a9": "We ship globally and offer various shipping options depending on order size and urgency. Standard freight, express shipping, and bulk container loads are all available. Contact our sales team for specific shipping quotes and lead times.",
    "faqPage.q10": "How can I become a distributor?",
    "faqPage.a10": "We welcome partnership inquiries from potential distributors worldwide. If you're interested in becoming a DRY-BAG distributor, please contact us with information about your company, market area, and experience in the moisture control or packaging industry.",

    "faqPage.badge": "Support",

    "faqPage.title2": "spørgsmål",
    "faqPage.description": "Find svar på almindelige spørgsmål om vores tørremidler, anvendelser og tjenester.",
    "faqPage.q1": "Hvad er et tørremiddel, og hvordan virker det?",
    "faqPage.a1": "Et tørremiddel er et hygroskopisk stof, der fremkalder eller opretholder en tilstand af tørhed i sit område. Det absorberer vandmolekyler fra den omgivende luft og reducerer effektivt fugtighedsniveauet. Vores tørremidler bruger materialer som silica gel, ler (Moclay) og calciumchlorid til at beskytte produkter mod fugtskader under opbevaring og forsendelse.",
    "faqPage.q2": "Hvilket tørremiddel er det rigtige til min anvendelse?",
    "faqPage.a2": "Det rigtige tørremiddel afhænger af flere faktorer: typen af varer, der skal beskyttes, fugtniveauer, varighed af nødvendig beskyttelse og regulatoriske krav. Silica gel er ideel til lægemidler og elektronik. Lerbaserede produkter som DRY-BAG I og III er fremragende til containerforsendelse. Calciumchlorid er bedst til tunge, lange søtransporter. Kontakt vores eksperter for personlige anbefalinger.",
    "faqPage.q3": "Hvor meget tørremiddel har jeg brug for til min container?",
    "faqPage.a3": "Mængden af tørremiddel afhænger af containerstørrelse, indhold, forventet transporttid og klimaforhold. Som hovedregel kan du til en 20ft container have brug for 8-12 enheder DRY-BAG til standardforsendelser. Til ruter med høj fugtighed eller følsomt gods kan der kræves mere. Vores team kan hjælpe med at beregne de nøjagtige krav til din specifikke situation.",
    "faqPage.q4": "Er jeres tørremidler sikre at bruge med fødevarer?",
    "faqPage.a4": "Ja, vores silica gel og lerbaserede tørremidler (DRY-BAG I og III) er lavet med FDA-godkendte materialer og er sikre til brug i fødevarenære anvendelser. De er ugiftige og kemisk inerte. De bør dog ikke indtages. For specifikke fødevaresikkerhedscertificeringer, kontakt os venligst.",
    "faqPage.q5": "Kan tørremidler regenereres og genbruges?",
    "faqPage.a5": "Nogle af vores tørremidler kan regenereres. DRY BAG Retail er specifikt designet til at være regenererbar—tør simpelthen indholdet i en ovn for at genoprette absorptionskapaciteten. Silica gel kan også regenereres i nogle tilfælde. Lerbaserede forsendelsestørremidler er typisk engangsbrug på grund af deres robuste natur.",
    "faqPage.q6": "Hvad er 'containerregn', og hvordan forhindrer tørremidler det?",
    "faqPage.a6": "Containerregn opstår, når temperaturudsving under forsendelse får fugt i luften inde i en container til at kondensere på containervæggene og loftet og derefter dryppe ned på godset. Dette kan forårsage skimmel, korrosion og vandskade. Tørremidler absorberer overskydende fugt fra luften og forhindrer kondens i at dannes.",
    "faqPage.q7": "Hvordan skal tørremidler opbevares før brug?",
    "faqPage.a7": "Tørremidler bør opbevares i deres originale, forseglede emballage indtil de er klar til brug. Opbevar dem på et køligt, tørt sted væk fra direkte sollys. Når emballagen er åbnet, bør ubrugte tørremidler forsegles igen i lufttætte beholdere eller poser for at forhindre for tidlig fugtabsorption.",
    "faqPage.q8": "Tilbyder I brugerdefinerede størrelser eller formuleringer?",
    "faqPage.a8": "Ja, vi tilbyder skræddersyede løsninger til specifikke anvendelser. Uanset om du har brug for bestemte størrelser, emballagetyper eller absorptionskapaciteter, kan vores team arbejde sammen med dig om at udvikle en skræddersyet fugtkontrolløsning. Kontakt os for at diskutere dine krav.",
    "faqPage.q9": "Hvilke forsendelsesmuligheder er tilgængelige?",
    "faqPage.a9": "Vi sender globalt og tilbyder forskellige forsendelsesmuligheder afhængigt af ordrestørrelse og hastende karakter. Standardgods, ekspressforsendelse og bulkcontainerlaster er alle tilgængelige. Kontakt vores salgsteam for specifikke forsendelsestilbud og leveringstider.",
    "faqPage.q10": "Hvordan kan jeg blive distributør?",
    "faqPage.a10": "Vi byder partnerskabsforespørgsler velkommen fra potentielle distributører verden over. Hvis du er interesseret i at blive DRY-BAG-distributør, kontakt os venligst med oplysninger om din virksomhed, markedsområde og erfaring inden for fugtkontrol- eller emballagebranchen.",
